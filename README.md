## Mathematical model review of inmune competition in cancer dynamics
 This work is a brief revision and study about the research article **A mathematical model of inmune competition related to cancer dynamics** by *Ilaria Brazzoli, Elena De Angelis and Pierre-Emmanuel Jabin.* My aim is to present its mains results, some technical highlights related to the mathematical proofs and comment about its implications and future research. Moreover I presents some basics concepts about kinetic theory for active particles in inmune competition situations that could be used in other topics if needed.
 I include the tex files and the slides

 Feel free to ask me about anything there.

 I made this work for my **PDE's in kinetic theory** course.
